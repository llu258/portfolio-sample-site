# Portfolio Site
Welcome! This is the repository file of my ongoing portfolio website project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes four sections: About, Projects, Experience, and Contacts.

Check out my site: <a href="llu258.github.io">llu258.github.io</a>

As of this writing, I am working on the responsiveness of the website then the landing page for my projects. Feel free to reach me out through LinkedIn and Github, I would really appreciate it.
